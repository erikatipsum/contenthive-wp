# Golden Grid System WP

A fork of the Golden Grid System, GGSWP is a starter theme that uses a folding grid for responsive web design. It’s built on a fluid-width grid system composed out of 18 even columns, two of which are used as outer margins, leaving 16 columns for use in design, which in turn can be combined into 8 columns or 4 columns as needed. They could also be doubled into 32 columns, but I don't think anyone needs a grid for 5000 CSS-px wide sites.
